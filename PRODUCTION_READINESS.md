# Production Readiness Checklist - Scheduled Campaigns Feature

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All scheduled campaigns functionality has been implemented and tested. The application is ready for live testing.

---

## 📋 Feature Summary

### Scheduled Campaigns Flow
1. **User schedules campaign** → Frontend converts shop timezone to UTC
2. **Backend stores** → `scheduleAt` stored in UTC, status set to `'scheduled'`
3. **Scheduler runs** → Checks every minute for due campaigns
4. **Campaign executes** → Status changes to `'sending'`, recipients calculated, SMS queued
5. **SMS sent** → Messages delivered via Mitto API
6. **Status updates** → Campaign transitions to `'sent'` or `'failed'`

---

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Scheduler Service (`services/scheduler.js`)
- ✅ `processScheduledCampaigns()` - Finds and queues due campaigns
- ✅ `startScheduledCampaignsProcessor()` - Runs every minute
- ✅ Transaction-based status updates (prevents duplicates)
- ✅ Error handling with status reversion

#### 2. Campaign Worker (`queue/jobs/campaignSend.js`)
- ✅ `handleCampaignSend()` - Executes scheduled campaigns
- ✅ Validates campaign state before sending
- ✅ Calls `sendCampaign()` service
- ✅ Error handling with retry logic

#### 3. Campaign Service (`services/campaigns.js`)
- ✅ `sendCampaign()` - Accepts `'draft'`, `'scheduled'`, and `'sending'` status
- ✅ `listCampaigns()` - Calculates recipient counts for scheduled campaigns
- ✅ `getCampaignById()` - Calculates recipient counts for scheduled campaigns
- ✅ Recipient calculation based on audience (contacts/segments)

#### 4. Startup (`index.js`)
- ✅ `startScheduledCampaignsProcessor()` called on server startup
- ✅ Initial 30-second delay for app initialization
- ✅ Runs every 60 seconds

---

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Campaign Creation (`frontend/src/pages/app/CampaignCreate.jsx`)
- ✅ Custom date picker (`GlassDateTimePicker`)
- ✅ Separate time picker modal (`GlassTimePicker`)
- ✅ Timezone conversion (`convertShopTimeToUTC`)
- ✅ Validation (date must be at least 1 minute in the future)
- ✅ Button states (disabled when scheduled but no date/time)
- ✅ Custom icons (no browser defaults)
- ✅ Display time in shop timezone with timezone label

#### 2. Timezone Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/timezone.js`)
- ✅ `convertShopTimeToUTC()` - Converts user selection to UTC
- ✅ `convertUTCToShopTime()` - Converts UTC to shop timezone for display
- ✅ Handles all IANA timezones
- ✅ Fallback error handling

#### 3. UI Components
- ✅ `GlassDateTimePicker` - Modal-based, centered, with backdrop
- ✅ `GlassTimePicker` - Separate modal, Save button, no auto-close
- ✅ `GlassSelectCustom` - Fixed error handling, stable on scroll
- ✅ All modals have max-height and internal scroll

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Send Now (Baseline)
1. Create campaign
2. Click "Send Now"
3. ✅ Campaign sends immediately
4. ✅ Recipients receive SMS
5. ✅ Status shows as "Sent"

### Test Case 2: Schedule Campaign (Same Timezone)
1. Set timezone to UTC in Settings
2. Create campaign
3. Schedule for 2 minutes in the future
4. ✅ Campaign shows as "Scheduled"
5. ✅ Recipient count displays correctly
6. ✅ Wait 2 minutes
7. ✅ Campaign executes automatically
8. ✅ Recipients receive SMS
9. ✅ Status updates to "Sent"

### Test Case 3: Schedule Campaign (Different Timezone)
1. Set timezone to `America/New_York` (EST, UTC-5) in Settings
2. Create campaign
3. Schedule for 2:00 PM EST (7:00 PM UTC)
4. ✅ Frontend converts to UTC correctly
5. ✅ Backend stores UTC time
6. ✅ Campaign executes at 2:00 PM EST (7:00 PM UTC)
7. ✅ Recipients receive SMS at correct local time

### Test Case 4: Recipient Count Display
1. Create scheduled campaign with audience "all"
2. ✅ Recipient count shows correct number (not 0)
3. ✅ After sending, count matches actual recipients

### Test Case 5: Time Picker UX
1. Click "Schedule for later"
2. Click "Select Time"
3. Select hour → ✅ Modal stays open
4. Select minute → ✅ Modal stays open
5. Click "Save Time" → ✅ Modal closes, time updates
6. ✅ Selected time displays correctly

## 🔍 Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` - For queue system
- `MITTO_API_KEY`, `MITTO_API_BASE`, `MITTO_TRAFFIC_ACCOUNT_ID` - For SMS sending
- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` - For Shopify integration

### Optional (for production)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (default: 'info')
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (production/development/test)

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Key Log Messages to Monitor

#### Scheduler
- `"Scheduled campaigns processor started"` - Confirms scheduler is running
- `"Found due scheduled campaigns"` - When campaigns are found
- `"Queued scheduled campaign for execution"` - When campaign is queued

#### Campaign Worker
- `"Processing campaign send job"` - When worker starts processing
- `"Campaign send job completed"` - When campaign is successfully sent
- `"Campaign send job failed"` - When campaign fails (check logs for reason)

#### Campaign Service
- `"Sending campaign"` - When sendCampaign is called
- `"Campaign queued for sending"` - When SMS jobs are queued
- `"Campaign scheduled successfully"` - When campaign is scheduled

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Blocking Issues
1. **Backend Lint**: 5 pre-existing errors in unrelated files (`controllers/automation-webhooks.js`, `services/webhook-registration.js`)
2. **Frontend Lint**: 1 non-blocking warning (`placeholder` variable in `GlassDateTimePicker.jsx`)

### Limitations
1. **Scheduler Interval**: Checks every 60 seconds (not real-time)
   - Campaigns may execute up to 60 seconds after scheduled time
   - This is acceptable for most use cases
2. **Timezone Conversion**: Uses iterative search (±12 hours)
   - Very rare edge cases may not find exact match
   - Fallback to closest match with warning log

## 🎯 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Ensure all environment variables are set
# Verify Redis connection
npm run test:redis

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start server
npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy dist/ folder to hosting service
```

### 3. Verification
1. Check server logs for: `"Scheduled campaigns processor started"`
2. Create a test scheduled campaign
3. Verify it appears in campaigns list with correct status
4. Wait for scheduled time
5. Verify campaign executes and sends SMS
