# Discounts Strategy & Integration

## Overview

This document explains our discount management strategy and why we use Shopify's native discount system instead of building our own.

## Why We Don't Create Discount Management Endpoints

### 🎯 **Strategic Decision**

We **deliberately chose NOT to implement** discount creation, update, or deletion endpoints in our SMS marketing app for the following reasons:

#### **1. Shopify Native Functionality**

- ✅ **Shopify Admin** already provides comprehensive discount management
- ✅ **Advanced Features** like usage limits, customer eligibility, product restrictions
- ✅ **Native Integration** with Shopify's checkout and order system
- ✅ **Better UX** - users already know how to use Shopify Admin

#### **2. Avoid Duplicate Functionality**

- ❌ **Redundant Code** - Why rebuild what Shopify already does perfectly?
- ❌ **Maintenance Overhead** - Extra code to maintain and debug
- ❌ **Sync Issues** - Potential conflicts between our system and Shopify's
- ❌ **User Confusion** - Two places to manage discounts

#### **3. Best Practices**

- ✅ **Single Source of Truth** - Shopify Admin as primary discount management
- ✅ **Native Integration** - Use Shopify's existing discount system
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity** - Less code, fewer bugs, easier maintenance
- ✅ **Better Performance** - No duplicate data storage or sync issues

## Our Discount Integration Strategy

### 🔗 **Read-Only Integration**

Instead of managing discounts, we provide **read-only integration** with Shopify's discount system:

#### **What We Provide:**

- ✅ **Discount Fetching** - Get existing discounts from Shopify
- ✅ **Discount Validation** - Check if discount codes exist and are active
- ✅ **Campaign Linking** - Link campaigns to existing Shopify discounts
- ✅ **Apply URL Generation** - Build discount apply URLs for campaigns

#### **What We DON'T Provide:**

- ❌ **Discount Creation** - Use Shopify Admin instead
- ❌ **Discount Updates** - Use Shopify Admin instead
- ❌ **Discount Deletion** - Use Shopify Admin instead
- ❌ **Discount Management UI** - Use Shopify Admin instead

### 📋 **API Endpoints**

| Endpoint                    | Method | Description                  | Purpose                            |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/discounts`                | GET    | Fetch discounts from Shopify | List existing discounts            |
| `/discounts/validate/:code` | GET    | Validate discount code       | Check if code exists and is active |
| `/discounts/campaign/:code` | GET    | Get discount for campaign    | Link discount to campaign          |
| `/discounts/apply-url`      | GET    | Build apply URL              | Generate discount apply links      |
| `/discounts/search`         | GET    | Search discounts             | Find discounts by query            |
| `/discounts/conflicts`      | GET    | Check conflicts              | Advisory conflict checking         |

### 🎯 **Campaign Integration**

Our campaigns can link to existing Shopify discounts:

```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "name": "Summer Sale Campaign",
    "discountCode": "SUMMER20",
    "message": "Get 20% off with code SUMMER20!",
    "applyUrl": "https://shop.myshopify.com/cart?discount=SUMMER20"
  }
}
```

## User Workflow

2. **Configure Settings** → Set usage limits, customer eligibility, etc.
3. **Test Discounts** → Use Shopify's built-in testing

5. **Monitor Performance** → Use Shopify's analytics + our campaign metrics
